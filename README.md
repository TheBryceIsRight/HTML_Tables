This project was made using the [Mozilla Developer Network local library tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)

To run the project:

[Install Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Install Express](https://expressjs.com/)

Once both Express and Node are installed, go the public directory of the project and run this command in the terminal:

```
DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* npm start
```
The website should start and become available on ```localhost:3000```. Nodemon is a part of this build which allows updates to the index.html to display in real time with a screen refresh, eliminating the need to restart express.
