Link to Express preview tool <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TkCqGw1gSZa-C3FX6jyM3GKB8bI91aRe/view?usp=sharing>

This project was made using the [Local Library Mozilla Developer Network tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)

To run the project:

[Install Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Install Express](https://expressjs.com/)

Once both Express and Node are installed, go the public directory of the project and run this command in the terminal:

```
DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* npm start
```
The website should start and become available on ```localhost:3000```. Since nodemon is a part of this build, updates to the index.html will display in real time with a screen refresh, eleminating the need to restart express.
